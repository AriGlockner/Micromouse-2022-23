- parts : 
      - 6 sensors with 2 pins for i squared c and ground (software placement)
           - one voltage regulator 
           - i squared c - protocol that is bi directional 
           - jst connectors
      - Teensy 4.1 : powerful microcontroller 
      - motor controllers : h bridge clip with capacitors 
           - can integrate into the board or kept it separate and connect manually
           - jst connectors
      - power switch
      - reset switch
      - battery protection : not required but nice to have
      - dip switches to go into debugging mode (nice to have)
      - leds for general debugging (nice to have)
      - whiteboard for labeling (nice to have)
      - gyro : type of sensor 

- find gyro - probably i squared c 
- create Teensy on kicad
- find / reverse engineering motor controllers (DRV8871) schematics
